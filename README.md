# NegativeRupert

The purpose of this repository is to sketch out the Lean proof steps
that would be required to complete a proof that the Noperthedron does
not have the Rupert property.

The citation `[SY25]` in the body of the Lean code refers to
["A convex polyhedron without Rupert's property"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18475)
by Jakob Steininger & Sergey Yurkevich.
