# Scale-invariant transition estimates

Near a silhouette transition, let `d` bound distance of the view from the
transition and let `x = tan(s / 2)` measure relative rotation.  A regular
exact-support certificate handles `x ≤ k d`.  In the complementary wedge a
defect certificate has normalized displacement

`2 x (c - x) / (1 + x²) - D d`.

The lemma below gives a denominator-free finite check ensuring that this
second expression is nonnegative throughout a bounded transition chart.
