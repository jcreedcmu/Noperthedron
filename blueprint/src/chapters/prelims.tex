TODO: This whole chapter needs organization, it's just a grab bag of miscellaneous results for now.

\section{Rupert Sets}

\begin{theorem}[Rupert Polyhedron iff Rupert Set]
\label{thm:rupert_iff_rupert_set}
\lean{rupert_iff_rupert_set}
\leanok
The following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item The convex polyhedron with vertex set $v$ is Rupert.
\item The convex closure of $v$ is a Rupert set.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\section{Poses}

TODO

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:view_pose_of_pose}
\lean{view_pose_of_pose, converted_pose_rupert_iff}
\leanok
Given a pose with zero offset, there exists a view pose that is equivalent to it.
\end{theorem}

\section{Pointsymmetry and Rupertness}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:rupert_implies_rot_rupert}
\lean{rupert_implies_rot_rupert}
\leanok
If a set is point symmetric and convex, then it being Rupert implies
it being purely rotationally Rupert.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

TODO: informalize proof
\end{proof}
