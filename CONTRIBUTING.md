# Contributing Guidelines

## Style

When convenient, we aim to follow the [Lean Library style
guide](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html)
and the [Mathlib naming
conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html).
However, following the naming conventions of Steininger & Yurkevich's
paper can take precedence.

## PRs

We prefer linear git history. Small, focused PRs are easy to review.
