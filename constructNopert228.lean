/-!
Native executable that reads and checks exact certificate data, then constructs
a proof that the fivefold-symmetric Nopert #228 is not Rupert.

This is analogous to `constructValidTable`: the expensive Boolean checks run
as parallel native code, while kernel-proved bridge theorems turn success into
the semantic proof consumed by the public theorem.
