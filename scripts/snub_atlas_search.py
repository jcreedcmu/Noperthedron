"""Atlas certificate search retargeted to the snub cube.

Installs the exact octahedral group (snub_atlas_group) and the snub
vertex tables into the shared atlas machinery. Symmetry matrices are
exact integers, so SYMMETRY_ERROR is zero. The view-space roots are kept
as the eight octants (respected by O); fundamental-domain restriction to
the octahedral wedge is left to a later refinement — searching a superset
is sound, merely redundant.
